	  "slide1_2": "But first, we need to know some useful concepts",
	  "slide1_3": "All matter is made from atoms. Individual atoms can combine with other atoms to form molecules",
	  "slide1_4": "Atoms and molecules are always in constant motion",
      "slide1_5": "Everything we can see and touch is made up of matter. Matter exists in three main forms: solids, liquids, and gases",
	  "slide1_6": "There's also the plasma state and has certain properties that other states does not have",
	  "slide1_7": "Every state of matter has different properties",
	  "slide1_8": "Let's see if we can use some of this properties to create some potions!",	 
	  "slide2_1": "In a liquid, particles of matter move relative to one another but remain in contact",
	  "slide2_2": "The movement of the particles causes the liquid to be variable in shape",
	  "slide2_3": "Liquids will flow and fill the lowest portion of a container, taking on the shape of the container but not changing in volume",
	  "slide3_1": "Gas is a state of matter that has no fixed shape and no fixed volume",
	  "slide3_2": "Gases also take the shape of their container, but they are much lighter than liquids",
	  "slide3_3": "What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles",
	  "slide3_4": "That means they will expand to fill any container they are placed in",
	  "slide3_5": "Within a gas, atoms and molecules are far apart from one another and bounce around independently",
	  "slide3_6": "They do not flow around one another as in a liquid, but rather ping off each other freely in all directions",
	  "slide4_1": "State is an extrinsic property of  matter that depends on physical conditions like temperature and pressure",
	  "slide4_2": "When a substance changes from solid to liquid or gas, its atoms and molecules begin to move relative to each other",
	  "slide4_3": "When it changes from liquid or gas to solid, its atoms and molecules stop moving relative to each other",
	  "slide4_4": "Water is a perfect example, if you add high temperature, it's molecules will losen and water will be in gas state",
	  "slide4_5": "If you add low temperature to the water, it's molecules cannot move freely and water will be in solid state",
	  "slide4_6": "If you add low temperature to evaporated water, the molecules will be less losen, but they can still move and slide past another",
